/* 
 * 
 *  Implements a 2-dimensional k-D tree. One begins to use the k-D tree by
 *  adding the bounding box of geometric "elements" to the tree structure
 *  through a call to "KDTreeAddElement". Every element should be of the same
 *  type, but could be a single point, a line segment, triangles, etc. Once
 *  all the element bounding boxes have been added, the user of the structure
 *  may make queries against the tree. The actual tree is constructed lazily
 *  when an actual query occurs on the structure.
 *
 *  This version only has one query -- intersection of a box with the elements
 *  and a set of "candidate" elements are returned. The candidates are identified
 *  by an index number (0, ...) signifying the order in which the element was
 *  added to the tree. It is up to the calling code to do additional processing
 *  based on the type of element being used to determine "real" intersections.
 *
 *  The process of actually building the tree takes "n log n" time. Queries 
 *  take "log n" time.
